# Code Thoughts
> snippets of code expressing thoughts and ideas I have

This is a code repository for my [Code Thoughts](https://opensea.io/collection/java-code-snippets) page on OpenSea.  
I believe that one of the true power of NFTs is creation of artist and it's fan base.   
Current rush for gold through duplication of similar artworks seems pretty toxic   
to me... I hope me and my arts contribution to a better future for NFT technology.
